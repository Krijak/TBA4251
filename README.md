## About
This vector based web Geographic informationsystem is developed as a project in the course "Programming in Geomatics" at NTNU. The aim of the course is to combine computer science with knowledge of geographic information systems. The subject is self-tought, and is a chance to experience a process of developing a web application and a geographic information system from start to end. The process involves everything form the choice of technology to design and implementation.

In this project, my focus have been on making a geographic informationsystem that are easy to use and with a nice user experience. The application may be used on any device, PC as well as a mobile phone (I have not been able to test the application on Apple-products, and can therefore not guarantee full compatibility with these kind of devices).
